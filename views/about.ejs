                My journey isn't typical. I started on the front lines as a <strong class="text-white font-bold">Fire Fighter</strong> and <strong class="text-white font-bold">Hazmat Operations Specialist</strong>. In those high-pressure environments, precision, data interpretation, and rapid decision-making weren't just skills—they were survival mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized that the same critical thinking used to manage hazardous materials could be applied to complex data systems. This curiosity led me to <strong class="text-white font-bold">Software Engineering</strong> and <strong class="text-white font-bold">AI/ML</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I bridge the gap between physical safety and digital intelligence. I build systems that are robust, efficient, and impactful. Whether it's analyzing incident data or deploying machine learning models, I bring the same level of dedication and discipline I learned in the fire service.
            </p>
